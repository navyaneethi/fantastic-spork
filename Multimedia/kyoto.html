        <h1> Kyoto, Japan - The City of Temples and Tradition</h1>
        <p>For centuries, Kyoto has nurtured an elegant culture. Its emphasis on cleanliness, 
            simplicity, and beauty stems from practices already integrated into daily life.

            <h2>KYOTO - Living Tradition</h2>
            <p>Kyoto City has a living culture that has been handed down for over a thousand years. You can feel it in how the streets, kimono, shrines, and temples make you aware of the changing of the seasons.
                It is our responsibility as people living today to pass on the city that has nurtured this irreplaceable culture, so that it will flourish another thousand years.
                This is a culture we want to cultivate together. It is not only for those who reside and work here, but also for those who visit Kyoto to experience the traditions that live on in this city.

            <h2>What's special about Kyoto</h2>
            <p>Kyoto was designed to be a capital city. Emperor Kanmu transferred the imperial court here in 794, and it remained until 1869. 
                Being the capital also made Kyoto a cultural center. You can feel the length of Kyotoâ€™s enduring influence in everything from 
                the continually refined cultural practices to the buildings and gardens that have stood the test of time. </p>
