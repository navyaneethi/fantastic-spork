<p>Hello <b>Andy!</b>
<br> <strong>WARNING warning</strong></p>

<p>
  We tested several products, including the <b>SuperSound 3000</b> for audio
  quality, the <b>QuickCharge Pro</b> for fast charging, and the
  <b>EcoClean Vacuum</b> for cleaning. The first two performed well, but the
  <b>EcoClean Vacuum</b> did not meet expectations.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Warning:</strong> This product may cause allergic reactions.
